  <mainDescription>Testers and other members of the development team may assist developers in this task by providing guidance, advice, and&#xD;
technical expertise. When issues are identified during the code review process, it is the responsibility of the developer&#xD;
to resolve them. This may involve working collaboratively to troubleshoot issues, writing code fixes or patches, and&#xD;
performing testing to verify that issues have been resolved. Ultimately, the goal of assisting developers in addressing&#xD;
issues is to help ensure that software code is of high quality and meets established standards for functionality, security,&#xD;
and performance.</mainDescription>
