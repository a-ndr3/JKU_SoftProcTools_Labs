  <mainDescription>Reading code and documentation is an essential task in the code review process, as it provides reviewers with critical&#xD;
insights into how software code is designed and implemented. By carefully examining code and documentation, reviewers can&#xD;
identify potential issues, provide feedback on code clarity and maintainability, and ensure that code is properly&#xD;
integrated with other components of the software system. The goal of reading code and documentation is to ensure that&#xD;
software products are of high quality, meet user needs, and deliver value to the organization.</mainDescription>
