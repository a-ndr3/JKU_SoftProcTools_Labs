  <mainDescription>Increased team collaboration is a critical work product in the code review process, as it fosters a culture of teamwork,&#xD;
communication, and continuous improvement. By working together to review and improve software code, team members can share&#xD;
knowledge and expertise, identify and address issues more effectively, and build stronger relationships based on mutual&#xD;
respect and trust. This can result in increased productivity, faster time to market, and better software products that meet&#xD;
