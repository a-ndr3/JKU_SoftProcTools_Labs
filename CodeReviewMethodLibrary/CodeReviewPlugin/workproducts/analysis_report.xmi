  <mainDescription>The analysis report is a critical work product in the code review process, as it provides stakeholders with an overview of&#xD;
the code review findings, including any defects or issues identified, and recommendations for improving code quality. The&#xD;
report may also include metrics on code quality, such as code complexity, as well as information on any follow-up actions&#xD;
needed to address identified issues. By producing an analysis report, development teams can ensure that software products&#xD;
are of high quality, meet user needs, and deliver value to the organization.</mainDescription>
